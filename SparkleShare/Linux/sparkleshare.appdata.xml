  <summary>Self hosted, instant, secure file sync</summary>
  <description>
    <p>SparkleShare creates a special folder on your computer. You can add remotely hosted folders (or "projects") to this folder. These projects will be automatically kept in sync with both the host and all of your peers when someone adds, removes or edits a file.</p>
    <p>SparkleShare was made to cover certain use cases, but doesn't handle every scenario well. To help you decide if SparkleShare is right for you, here's a few examples of what it does well and less well:</p>
    <p>Great:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Frequently changing project files, like text, office documents, and images</li>
      <li>Tracking and syncing files edited by multiple people</li>
      <li>Reverting a file to any point in its history</li>
      <li>Preventing spying on your files on the server using encryption</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Not so great:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Full computer backups</li>
      <li>Storing your photo or music collection</li>
      <li>Large binary files that change often, like video editing projects</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Have fun!</p>
