	backend (experimental Mercurial support). Added support for Growl to show
	notifications on Mac.

	usage, less crashes. Instant notifications of new changes instead of polling.
	Refreshed event log HTML theme. Keeping logs in memory for faster reopening and
	loads more goodness.


0.2-beta2 for Mac (Sat Feb 12, 2011):

	Hylke: Mac version! Massive restructure of the code to an MVC-like model
	to make building different front-ends easier. Ported the event logs to
	Webkit, so users can style it to their liking. It also reduces the amount
	of UI-porting that needs to be done between toolkits.


0.2-beta1 (Sun Sep 5, 2010):

	Hylke: Aside from the usual bug fixes and behind the scenes work I mainly
	added features that increase productivity in the event logs. Not only does
	it look a lot prettier, each entry in an event log now has a clickable link
	for easy access to files. It refreshes automatically on new events as well.
	The Nautilus plugin now	has the "Copy Web Link" context	menu item, which
	makes sharing links a whole lot easier.
