## How does it work?

SparkleShare creates a special folder on your computer. You can add remotely hosted folders (or "projects") to this folder. These projects will be automatically kept in sync with both the host and all of your peers when someone adds, removes or edits a file.


## Setting up a host

SparkleShare uses the version control system [Git](https://git-scm.com/) under the hood, so setting up a host yourself is relatively easy. Using your own host gives you more privacy and control, as well as lots of cheap storage space and higher transfer speeds. We've made a simple [script](https://github.com/hbons/Dazzle) that does the hard work for you. If you need to manage a lot of projects and/or users it may be worth setting up a [GitLab](https://www.gitlabhq.com) instance.
