# SparkleShare

SparkleShare is a collaboration and sharing tool that is designed to keep
things simple and to stay out of your way. It allows you to instantly sync
with any Git repository you have access to.

SparkleShare currently works on Linux and Mac. A Windows port and mobile
device support are planned for the future.

# Build on Linux

Installing the build dependencies on Debian or Ubuntu:

   $ sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp2 mono-runtime mono-devel monodevelop \
     libndesk-dbus1.0-cil-dev nant libnotify-cil-dev libgtk2.0-cil-dev mono-gmcs \
     libwebkit-cil-dev intltool libtool python-nautilus libndesk-dbus-glib1.0-cil-dev

For Ubuntu libappindicator support, run the following before building:

   $ sudo apt-get install libappindicator0.1-cil-dev 
   
On Fedora:

   $ sudo yum install gtk-sharp2-devel mono-core mono-devel monodevelop \
     ndesk-dbus-devel ndesk-dbus-glib-devel nautilus-python-devel nant \
     notify-sharp-devel webkit-sharp-devel webkitgtk-devel libtool intltool \
     gnome-doc-utils

You can build and install SparkleShare like this:

   $ ./configure --prefix=/usr (or ./autogen.sh if you build from the repository)
   $ make
   $ sudo make install

Note:

   Use '--prefix=/usr' if you want the Nautilus extension to work.


# Run on Mac

Just double-click the SparkleShare bundle.


# Build on Mac

Install Xcode, the Mono Framework, MonoDevelop and the MonoMac plugin (you find it in Add-in Manager).

You may need to adjust some environment variables to let the build environment tools find mono:
   
   $ export PATH=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/bin:$PATH
   $ export PKG_CONFIG=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/bin/pkg-config
   $ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/lib/pkgconfig

Install git, automake, and intltool using MacPorts:

   $ sudo port install git-core automake intltool
   
Start the first part of the build:

   $ ./autogen.sh --enable-gtkui=no
   $ make
   
Now that you have compiled the libraries, open 'SparkleShare/Mac/SparkleShare.sln' in
MonoDevelop and start the build.

To create the SparkleShare.app, select Project from the menu bar 
and click "Create Mac Installer..." Save the SparkleShare.app somewhere.

Paste the contents of the following file in SparkleShare.app/Contents/MonoBundle/config:
https://raw.github.com/gist/1aeffa61bac73fc08eca/0c0f09ef9e36864c35f34fd5e8bf4f99886be193/gistfile1.txt

Copy /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/lib/libintl.dylib 
to SparkleShare.app/Contents/Resources

Now you should have a working bundle that you can run.
