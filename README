SparkleShare
============

SparkleShare is a collaboration and sharing tool that is designed to keep
things simple and to stay out of your way. It allows you to instantly sync
with any Git repository you have access to.

Though SparkleShare is not made to be a graphical frontend 
for git or a backup tool, it may be useful for other kinds of purposes as well, 
like backing up small files or monitoring your favourite project. In contrast 
to the projects name, we will very likely refuse to implement your personal 
ponies.

SparkleShare currently works on Linux and Mac. A Windows port and mobile
device support are planned for the future.

Run on Linux:
=============

SparkleShare currently requires:

   - git >= 1.7
   - gtk-sharp2 >= 2.12.7
   - mono-core >= 2.2
   - ndesk-dbus >= 0.6
   - openssh
   - gvfs >= 1.3
   - intltool
   - libnotify

For help:

   $ sparkleshare --help

Note:

   SparkleShare creates its own RSA keypair in ~/config/sparkleshare/ and uses 
   that for authentication. Please mind this if you're planning to set up your 
   own server by hand.


Build on Linux:
===============

Installing the build dependencies on Debian or Ubuntu:

   $ sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp2 mono-runtime mono-devel monodevelop \
     libndesk-dbus1.0-cil-dev nant libnotify-cil-dev libgtk2.0-cil-dev \
     libwebkit-cil-dev intltool libtool python-nautilus libndesk-dbus-glib1.0-cil-dev

For Ubuntu libappindicator support, run the following before building:

   $ sudo apt-get install libappindicator0.1-cil-dev 


On Fedora:

   $ sudo yum install gtk-sharp2-devel mono-core mono-devel monodevelop \
     ndesk-dbus-devel ndesk-dbus-glib-devel nautilus-python-devel nant \
     notify-sharp-devel webkit-sharp-devel webkitgtk-devel libtool intltool \
     gnome-doc-utils


You can build and install SparkleShare like this:

   $ ./configure --prefix=/usr (or ./autogen.sh if you build from the repository)
   $ make
   $ sudo make install

Note:

   Use '--prefix=/usr' if you want the Nautilus extension to work.


Run on Mac:
===========

Just double-click the SparkleShare.app.


Build on Mac:
=============

Install the Mono Framework, MonoDevelop and the MonoMac plugin (you find it in Add-in Manager).

You may need to adjust some environment variables to let the build environment tools find mono:
   
   $ export PATH=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/bin:$PATH
   $ export PKG_CONFIG=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/bin/pkg-config
   $ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/lib/pkgconfig

Then you need either MacPorts or Homebrew. Go on and choose one of the next two sections.


Using MacPorts
--------------

Install git, automake, and intltool:

   $ sudo port install git-core automake intltool

Start the first part of the build:

   $ ./autogen.sh
   $ make

The last step will give you some errors in SparkleShare.exe, ignore these and go on to the
MonoDevelop section.


Using Homebrew
--------------

Because there are old versions of autoconf and automake installed on OS X, they are not in 
the official master branch. It's easy to create the formulas:

   $ brew create $url
   
Now install the formulas.

You can have a look at this branch for the created Formulas:
https://github.com/toabi/homebrew/commits/sparkleshare

You also have to comment out the 'keg_only' in gettext and remove it if you already
installed it. If you created the formulas install them:

	$ brew install git autoconf automake intltool gettext

Now start the first part of the build:

	$ export ACLOCAL_FLAGS="-I /usr/local/share/aclocal"
	$ cd SmartIrc4net
	$ ./autogen.sh
	$ cd ..
	$ ./autogen.sh
	$ make

Ignore the error and continue to the MonoDevelop-part.


Building the Cocoa UI MonoDevelop
---------------------------------

Now that you have compiled the libraries, open 'SparkleShare/Mac/SparkleShare.sln' in
MonoDevelop and start the build.

To create the SparkleShare.app, select Project from the menu bar and click "Create Mac Installer..."
