These are notes to aid development of the ML Sparkle Backend


REST functions required
/ Login (Digest, Basic, with https)
- Search for all docs under a URI, returning URIs (first sync)
/ Search for all docs since last modified date under a URI, returning URIs (subsequent syncs)
- Ensure auto directory (URL?) creation is on, on the ML server
/ Begin transaction
/ Commit transaction
/ Rollback transaction
/ Put document
/ Get document(s)
/ Delete document

Questions outstanding
/ Do we have a .NET REST wrapper?
- How do we handle local deletes?
- How do we handle remote deletes? (Warn, ask user: Option A: delete locally, Option B: Keep files (added to remote on next sync) )


SparkleShare specific work
+ plugin XML descriptor
+ Link ML project to main project resources
- Compilation config in main project
- Ensure files linked in
- basic test

*** replace current (broken) folder-is-connection-url method with configuration saved on this new sync connection
